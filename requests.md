We are currently accepting read requests from authors and publishers in the form of ARCs and finished copies. As neither of us own an e-reader, we are unfortunately unable to accept e-books at this time. Please note that we are currently looking at options to be able to accept this format. We are also not accepting self-published books unless they really catch our attention.

Unless otherwise requested, our reviews will be posted prior to the release date for new publications or within 14 days for already released books.

## Types of Books we will Review
The focus of this blog is Young Adult and Middle Grade Fiction. Though we will read anything that falls within these two genres, we do have preferences in terms of sub genre which you may consider when making your request.

### Our personal favourite sub genres
Olivia: Fantasy, paranormal, dystopian, science fiction.

Sarah: Dystopian, contemporary, historical, light science fiction.

## Who will review my book?
You are welcome to request either Sarah or Olivia for your review. Should you have no preference, we will decide ourselves based on our personal reading lists and interests.

## Review Content
All reviews include: title, author, publisher, release date, cover image, our star rating as well as the review itself. Upon request, we can add additional information (such as link to the author's/publisher's website/blog). Just let us know!

## Negative Reviews
With very few exceptions, we do review every book that we read and the contents of our reviews will always be our honest opinions. If we do not like a book, we will still highlight the parts that we did like. Our reviews will never be intentionally disrespectful towards the author or the book in question. Should any issues arise, we will contact you immediately.

## Review Posting
The reviews will be posted on this blog, Goodreads, and promoted through our instagram account. We are also able to email a copy if requested.

## Contact
The best way to contact us is through e-mail at dreamteamreads&#64;gmail.com.

Thank you for your consideration!
