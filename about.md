Who are we? What even is this blog?

We are two book loving, wanderlusting, language learning, Canadian girls who form one hell of a team and read (#DreamTeamReads!) We both love to travel (Sarah will soon be in Japan for at least a year) and read young adult fiction, so you will see a lot of those two things on here.

      Hello there folks! My name is Olivia and I am a Toronto based reader with a particular fondness for pretty book covers and Young Adult Fiction. When the two come together, it's magical. I love a good &#35;ThrowBackYA and make it my mission to build my library on a budget (&#35;Thriftay!). I also really like hashtags, so you will probably find one or two in my reviews. Also GIFS. Basically I'm stuck in the early 2010s.
