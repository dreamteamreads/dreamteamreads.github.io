Often life seems to be an all or nothing thing. Either everything is happening or nothing is happening.

Currently, everything is happening for both Sarah and I. She has moved to Japan to begin an exciting year there (I'm crying inside. Happy tears for her, sad tears for me) while I am now down a roommate and therefore get the big room! (I know, my life is very exciting) which means moving the apartment around the fews hours I'm not working.

Suffice to say, we are both like this baby here:

Giddy, content, but ultimately very tired.

For that reason, we are going on a ~1 week hiatus! We will still be active on Twitter and Instagram, but there won't be any posts here until August 16th. Just enough time to let us get our lives together.
