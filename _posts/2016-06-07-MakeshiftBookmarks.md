**Scenario:** You are about to board a 3-hour train and have only just noticed that you have forgotten your book at home – the tragedy, the horror, the... opportunity? Happily you find a bookstore, buy a new (or used!) book and are ensured a blissful 3 hours of reading!

However, since you had not planned to acquire this book, you have no book mark and since we all know folding corners is total sacrilege – which, admittedly, we’ve all done in dire moments that we are not proud of – I have assembled below a list of random items I commonly use as makeshift bookmarks.

**1. Transit passes/tickets**

Works great as a bookmark, plus, you have easy access to the transit pass slipped in the pages of your book rather than having to dig it out of your purse/pocket/bag every time you need it!

**2. Post-It notes**

Fun and colourful! The adhesive allows you to remind yourself of the actual section of the page you are at and, as an added bonus, you can use it to write reminders to yourself or notes about your book.

**3. Bobby-pins**

I know this one is not ideal, since bobby pins are not exactly flat, but I find them thin enough to not damage the book and easy to slip over a page as a placeholder. Besides, when given the choice between pinning an unruly curl or marking my place in my book, I’ll always chose the latter! ;)
