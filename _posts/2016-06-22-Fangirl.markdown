Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories? And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?<br> <sup>Adapted from &#58; GoodReads</sup>

I am a fangirl.

When I was 11 years old, I discovered the Harry Potter discussion boards and it was all downhill from there. Fanfiction, RP&#42;, making graphics for my favourite OTPs: I was hooked and I was hooked hard. The list of fandoms that I was into only grew as my friend list did, mostly because we would constantly be sending each other recs. So when I found out that this book existed, I knew that I *had* to read it.

Simply put, I loved this book. I am usually not reeeeally a huge fan of every day fiction (preferring fantasy, science fiction, etc.), so I didn't expect myself to love this book. I knew I'd enjoy it, certainly, but I didn't think I'd love it to the point that I did.

<sup>&#42;For those who don’t know, RP stands for Role Play. In this context, it is when 2 or more people write scenes together online. Each writer is responsible for at least 1 character, and the idea is that the scene is built together, but you never know where your writing partner is going to go with it. Writers will often plot the general outline of where it’s going, but everything in between is in the moment and spontaneous. Though I personally find that RP isn’t as popular as it once was, you can still find groups on the internet. Tumblr still has a decently large community for it.</sup>

## What makes this book so good?

I'm glad you asked. I think what made this book so great is simply how relatable it is. The fandom in the story (Simon Snow) is basically Harry Potter (though Harry Potter is mentioned in the book at one point, there is no fooling us. Simon is Harry, and Baz is Draco), so already there is a very easy entry point for people who are part of that fandom. It also introduces the world of Fan Fiction (FF) (I talk about this in my ramble <a href="http://dreamteamreads.com/2016/06/14/fanfiction/" target="blank_">here</a>, should you be so inclined to check that out). Fan Fiction is something that has become much more mainstream in the last couple years, and this book really shows how true that is. The fact that Rainbow Rowell could write this book and get it published shows a lot about how society views this kind of stuff.

I remember when I was younger, in the early days of my getting into Fan Fiction, no one spoke about FF outside of their Fandom friends. For most people, it was a dark secret that you kept to yourself, for fear of being judged or ridiculed. Speaking to my friends from back then, they all say that they experienced the same feelings on it. Nowadays, it's almost weird if you don't know what Fan Fiction is, and many people not only openly read it, but also write it. I'm not saying that the stigma surrounding it is totally gone, but it certainly is better than it used to be.

## Characters

The characters in this book are anxious, unstable, out of control, kind, hilarious, shallow, and everything else on the spectrum of human characteristics. This also means that there is likely to be a character that every reader will identify with or appreciate. For me, that was Levi. Though his grammar is terrible, and he makes horrible jokes, his lightheartedness is infectious. Cath is flawed in all the right ways, and makes you feel like you can get your shit together.

## The Bad

"If you loved the book so much, why did you only give it a 4?" What a good question Olivia's sub conscience! This book lost the star for a couple reasons, but the main one was the ending. I closed the book 100% unsatisfied with the results. Perhaps even more so because I was reading an ebook, so I couldn't tell how far I was from the end until I got there. The first thing I did when I finished it (ironically enough) was to go see what Fan Fiction had been written about the book (I found <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10016417/1/I-Have-Loved-You" target="blank_">this really great 5-years-later type story</a>).

## BUT WAIT

I proceeded to forgive Rainbow Rowell for this abrupt ending when I found out that SHE WROTE A SIMON SNOW NOVEL.

So naturally, I jumped on that and read it as quickly as I could. I don't think there will be a review of that book on here, but it is a good way to keep the Fan Girl feeling going after you finish this book.
