Yesterday, I lived any book lovers nightmare.

I was at the grocery store picking up some buns for dinner (delicious, delicious pulled pork). The outfit I was wearing had no pockets (dear dress makers take note: pockets. They are amazing) and I did not have enough hands for all the things I was carrying (namely my phone, my copy of Darklight, some olives and a bag of croissants). Now, naturally, I had to put everything down on the shelf so that I could grab the buns.

Because, being the genius that I am, I never picked the book back up. The olives, croissants and my phone, they made the cut, but the book: nope. It wasn't until today when I went to grab it that I realized it was gone. I even called the grocery store to see if it had by some miracle been brought to the lost and found. No such luck.

So now I'm down a copy of Darklight (which I was in the middle of) and I've got to wait until the new copy arrives from Amazon.

On the bright side, I only recently stopped using my metropass as my bookmark because Sarah kept bugging me about it... I've never been happier to have listened to her. Thanks Sarah! This is why you're the wise one.
