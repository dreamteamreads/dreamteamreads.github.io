I have seen this book all over Bookstagram for months, so going into it, I had high expectations. I (as you all know) have a terrible tendency of judging books by their covers, and this one definitely caught my attention. Simple design, but that threatened to have all the amazing things that make fantasy such a great genre. Royalty! Murder! Magic! Power! Yes!

When I finished the last page however, I was overcome with an overwhelming sense of "ehn." The more I think about it though, the more I can objectively see why it is a good book. Still, I have a couple bones to pick.

## May the Odds ever be in your favour little lightening girl
First things first, and I think we need to get this out of the way before breaking down this story any further. The plot feels very Hunger Games-ey. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. I loved The Hunger Games Series. I cried, I shook, I got angry, all the rest of it. However, because I've already gone through that emotional rollercoaster, reading the Red Queen just made me feel like I've been here before. So I suppose it felt like The Hunger Games rewrapped in Fantasy coverings.

The biggest transgression here was concerning <span class="spoiler">the secret base that is in <strike>District 13</strike> the nuclear wasteland that everyone thinks can't support human life.</span> The parallels there are undeniable. Yet another one comes in the caste system itself. One big difference is that unlike in The Hunger Games, the rich/powerful do mingle and see the day to day lives of the poor, making it 10 times worse somehow.

## Prince Charming
Cal. Oh Cal. He’s good, but almost too good. You could argue that in his perfection, he is flawed, but the fact that he is always the perfect son and the perfect soldier and the perfect man always trying to save Mare drove. Me. Insane. What we need is a flawed hero. One who is passionate, one who is good and bad.

One like I was really hoping Maven would turn out to be. The moment he <span class="spoiler">joined the Red Guard, I felt he would betray them.</span> I could feel it in my bones. That doesn’t mean I wasn’t routing for <span class="spoiler"> things to turn out differently and for Maven to actually be good and trying to help his people. After all, what a better story than that of a child who sees their parents as they are and decides to be more?</span> However, much as I was rooting for it, I knew how it would turn out.

However, it isn’t all bad (I did give this book a 3 after all). Let’s talk about the good.

#Rise, Red like the Dawn
The world that the story exists in is pretty neat. I've seen it compared to X-men because of the powers and that is a pretty solid comparison. There is also a lot of peripheral stuff going on. For instance, the fact that there is nuclear wasteland around suggests that humanity threw itself into WW3 to create this world. I always like a good piece of speculative "what if we blow ourselves up" fiction, so I enjoyed that. (Sidenote, if you're also into that, check out *A Canticle for Leibowitz* or *The Crysalids*)

Also good, surprisingly:

## What next
For all my complaining, I think that I will be picking up Glass Sword sometime soon to find out what happens to Mare and co next.
