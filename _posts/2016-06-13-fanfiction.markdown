I feel that when it comes to Fan Fiction, there are 3 distinct schools of thought.

1. OMG BEST THING EVER I WILL MAKE ALL THESE CHARACTERS LIVE FOREVER!
2. It is a lesser form of literature that I am above.
3. What the shit is FF?


If you are part of category 3, allow me to explain. Fan Fiction, as the name suggests, is any story that takes place in an existing universe (ex. Harry Potter) that is written by someone other than the original author. Fans will often say that they belong to a fandom (I think fandom = fan kingdom, but I'm just guessing here) and often will write in that fandom.

A lot of author's recognize how powerful fan fiction can be as a way to keep your world alive in between sequels and/or long after your series has ended. Others are fervently against it. Anne Rice has infamously said on the topic:

> "I do not allow fan fiction. The characters are copyrighted. It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters. I advise my readers to write your own original stories with your own characters. It is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes."

I personally believe that Diana Gabaldon topped Rice in 2010 when she said ["OK, my position on fan-fic is pretty clear: I think it’s immoral, I *know* it’s illegal, and it makes me want to barf whenever I’ve inadvertently encountered some of it involving my characters"](http://web.archive.org/web/20100507173749/http://voyagesoftheartemis.blogspot.com/2010/05/fan-fiction-and-moral-conundrums.html){:target="_blank"}



A lot of books that have been published over the years were originally fan fiction. Fifty Shades of Grey for instance is widely known to have originally been Twilight Fan Fiction and Cassadra Clare's City of Bones is rumoured to have come from her Harry Potter FF days.
