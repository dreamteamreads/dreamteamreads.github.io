Okay folks, strap yourselves in because I have a lot of feelings about this book. I read it in one sitting, which is only a good idea if you are ready for a rollercoaster of emotions. Which, for the record, I was not. This book has torn me up inside because I have two *very* strong and conflicting feelings about it. The result is two ratings and two reviews... To better understand my conflicting feelings on this subject, I should probably explain a couple things...

I read this book last Friday (4 days ago) and after I finished it, I sat in my chair, like this, for a good 10 minutes:

I then rushed off to write up my review, rating the book at a **4.5**. I have now come back to it, 5 days later, having had time to better digest it and honestly, I really don't know how to rate Hush Hush.

What I have therefore decided to do is to give you both reviews. Sort of. Below you will find the initial post from when I was running my book high written in the regular site font. You will also find my <span class="reviewupdate">added notes</span> which constitute my "has had time to calm down and really reflect on what she read" version.

Ultimately though, after lots of reflection time, I've decided that I really enjoyed the book. Despite a lot of flaws (many of which I list below), I still put the book down feeling amazingly happy, and isn't that the entire point? Either way, I would encourage you to read it and make up your own mind. Without further ado, my review!

# Plot (and my thoughts)
 Reading this book was what I imagine taking heroin must be like. Allow me to set up the story: Meet Nora, a plain teenage girl living in a small town. Self sufficient, Nora is a good student who has never fallen for anyone. Enter Patch, the mysterious new transfer who Nora is partnered up with in her Biology class (not just biology, but a biology class dedicated to human attraction and reproduction).

Now I know what you might be thinking. Olivia, are you reviewing Twilight? And that is *exactly* why this book lost half a star. When I first started reading, all I could think of was Twilight. Except instead of being broody and angsty like his Cullen counterpart, Patch gives no fucks about anything and comes across as very confident and frankly, pretty arrogant. <span class="reviewupdate">(He does however, share some traits with the infamous Cullen. More about that in characters section below)</span> Further, instead of push her away, Patch actively pursues Nora from the get go, and seems to be very good at reading her. Shortly after, Nora begins to suspect that someone is following her and with it, tragedy. Oh, and there are angels!

I don't want to give away too much pertaining to the plot itself, because I want anyone reading this book to experience it fresh the first time they read it, but what I will say is that the action starts up pretty quickly and there aren't a lot of stagnant moments. The end action sequence in particular had my mind going a mile a minute and I was *physically exhausted* after reading it. I just kept asking wtf was going on. What this book does have a lot of are REALLY stomach twistingly awkward and amazing moments (SPOILER: <span class="spoiler">For instance, when Nora goes to interrogate Patch's coworkers in disguise and finds out he's working on his night off. The entire scene is perfection. The sexual tension in this book is pretty... well, intense. I kind of hate myself a little for even saying that, but hey, someone has to say it.</span> <span class="reviewupdate">This I don't take back. I 100% stand behind. #SorryNotSorry?</span>)

# Characters
This section could go forever if I let it, so I will try to be brief. As stated above, the two main characters of this novel are Nora and Patch. Nora, for all her "innocence" and Bella like behaviour, delivers a few really great one liners and quips. She does make some pretty questionable decisions, but she is only 16, so I mean, I can't really fault her for that. I made some pretty terrible judgement calls at 16 (she said, as if she were a wise soul. Don't let me fool you folks, I am really not that wise!)

Patch, who started off way too Edward Cullen for my taste, redeems himself through the book (SPOILER: <span class="spoiler">the scene with the 200$ jumps to mind: "are you rich?" "No, I won that money the other night. The bank is closed."</span> LAWL. <span class="reviewupdate">This LAWL also stands. I still enjoy that moment</span>) Unlike Edward who is a rich pretty boy who follows the rules, Patch is very rough around the edges. Most of what he has, he wins playing pool and the rest he gets from busing tables. He's not afraid to tell it like it is and is *definitely* not a prude like Edward.

<span class="reviewupdate"> I also want to add that some of Patch's behaviour is not always super cool. An argument could be made that his and Nora's relationship can be at times abusive (SPOILER: <span class="reviewupdatespoiler">I mean in the beginning of the story he does want to kill her... also another Twilight link)</span> in the sense that he doesn't seem to take no for an answer (not in the physical sense, but in the whole pursuing of her. He very stubbornly pursues her and some have said that this is not okay). However, at what point is it wanted and unwanted attention? Nora's inner monologue suggests that she is interested in him, but her pride doesn't want to let her admit that. Throughout the novel, she keeps making decisions that brings her closer to him. Further, whether you view someone's actions as cute or creepy is very much influenced by whether or not you are interested in the person who is exhibiting the behaviour. If Nora is indeed interested in Patch (which she is here) then his arrogant behaviour isn't creepy because it isn't unwanted.</span>

<sup>How I met your mother sums this idea up pretty well.</sup>

<span class="reviewupdate">So, much as I understand those who say that this pairing doesn't sit well with them, I don't agree that these characters are in an abusive relationship worthy of Twilight infamy.</span>

One character who I really, really did not enjoy however, was Nora's best friend, Vee. She is supposed to be the comedic relief but her jokes fall flat every. single. time. Urg. She, like Nora, has poor decision making skills and can come off as quite obnoxious at times. I did not enjoy scenes with her in them. <span class="reviewupdate">Does that sound mean? Perhaps a little. But I'm sticking to my guns on this one.</span>

All in all, I really enjoyed this book and it definitely gave me that readers high that any fandom appreciating reader strives for. Had it been less Twilight-ey, it would have scored even higher, but hey, nothing's perfect.
