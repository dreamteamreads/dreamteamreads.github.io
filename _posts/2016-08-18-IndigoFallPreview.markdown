Last night I had the opportunity to visit the Chapters Indigo Headquarters here in Toronto for their Fall YA Book Preview. I’d never been to a book preview before this, so I didn’t really know what to expect, but OHMYGOD IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

*Some of the books above were actually already released books with the dust covers of the new releases on them. That's how careful they need to be with some of the upcoming releases.*{: .img-caption-center}

You’re probably wondering how I ended up there (I kept asking that myself actually). These events, I’d always thought, were reserved for veteran/well-known bloggers and promoters. Well, it turns out that I was wrong. Indigo posted about this event on Twitter a couple weeks ago and opened up tickets to the general public. I saw the post a little late, so by the time I went to the Eventbrite page, they were all gone. Not one to give up so easily, I sent a message to the team at IndigoTeen on Twitter asking if there was a waitlist and wham, bam, thank you m’am, I was on it! I followed up once or twice and on Monday, I got a message saying that a spot opened up! I sent them my email and that was it! I was on the list! Lesson to be learned here: Always ask (except when it comes to pregnancy. Never ask someone if they're pregnant. Even if they look like they swallowed a watermelon. It's just a bad idea).

## First Impression

![Candy Bar](\assets\blogimages\fallpreview\candybar.png){: .pull-right .img-responsive .thumbnail .img-padding}
When we first arrived, there was a long table with bags full of books on each chair. On the bar beside the table, they had pizza and a candy bar set up so that everyone could refuel before the presentation started. It was very cool to be surrounded by so many people who are just as into YA as I am, and I recognized a couple faces/twitter handles.

We all sat down and the presentation began. We went through some big fall releases, talked about the feedback that these books were getting, what the stories were about, who they might appeal to, etc. Then on break, some took pictures in the photo booth, and we had the chance to meet everyone else in the room.

There was also a surprise in store for us.

Author E.K. Johnston decided to stop by and jumped in to help present the fall releases. She. Was. Hilarious. She also spoke to us a little about her upcoming fall releases (Including Star Wars: Ahsoka!). She was also kind enough to bring some ARCs of her upcoming winter release, Spindle, which she signed for us all. (It is currently sitting very near the top of my tbr pile).

At the end of the presentation came probably one of the most exciting parts. On the bar they had a bunch of ARCs set up that we were invited to take home. Among them was... wait for it...

 | **The Thousandth Floor!!**{: .img-caption-center} |

That's right! The book I've been drooling allll over on social media. Though I will still definitely be buying the hardcover when it comes out (because hello have you seen that cover design. It is beautiful. Gatsby meets High Rise.), but now I will get to read it before it comes out on the 30th!

This brings me to the next thing I want to talk about.

## My most anticipated Fall 2016 releases

After last night, there are 5 novels that I plan to dig into over the next few weeks, all that will be released over the next few months. So to finish off this post, I'm going to talk about the five books I can't wait to read!

![My to be read pile](\assets\blogimages\fallpreview\onetwothree.gif){: .img-center }

### 1. *The Sun is Also a Star* by **Nicola Yoon** (Release date: November 1st 2016)
I'm not typically a huge contemporary YA person (I have tried about 4 times to get into The Unexpected Everything and I am still having a hard time), but based on what people said about *Everything, Everything*, I need to give this novel a try. I took a look at the author's note and I really like her style so far, so stay tuned for that!

### 2. *The Forgetting* by **Sharon Cameron** (Release date: September 13th 2016)
In a world where humanity's memory is wiped clean every 12 years, one girl is able to remember everything. She begins to use this ability to solve the mystery of it all. If there is one thing that really gets me, it's memory loss. My biggest fear is not losing those around me but being forgotten by them. Gets me every time.

### 3. *The Thousandth Floor* by **Katharine McGee** (Release date: August 30th 2016)
I've already mentioned this one, but *The Thousandth Floor* seems to have everything that I love in a novel. Broken characters, a futuristic version of our world, commentary on social hierarchies. Oh yeah, I'm about to devour this one.

### 4. *Fate of Flames* by **Sarah Raughley** (Release date: November 22nd 2016)
The Effigies are four girls who can control the elements. Their job? Protect the world from an enemy known as the Phantoms. But when technology makes them redundant, they go their own ways. Until the day that the technology breaks in New York City, and the Effigies need to come back together. Only problem? They have 0 interest in coming together.

### 5. *Spindle* by **E.K. Johnston** (Release date: December 6th 2016)
The sequel to *A Thousand Nights* is a retelling of sleeping beauty. Though it's a sequel, it takes place 1500 years after the first novel, and can therefore be read as a standalone (though you will find out about how *A Thousand Nights* ends.) E.K. Johnston presented this one to us herself, and she definitely sold me on it.

## To conclude
