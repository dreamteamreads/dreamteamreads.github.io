I was at the grocery store yesterday picking up some buns for dinner [pulled pork, in case you were wondering]. As the weather is quickly turning warm, I had my coat in my bag, and not enough hands for all the things I was carrying [namely my phone, my copy of Darklight, some olives and a bag of croissants] so, being the genius that I am, I set down my copy of Darklight so that I could get the buns.

And then I left it there. Who knows how long it sat there, feeling abandoned before some YA fan saw it and went "yeah, I'll take that home." I shudder to think.

So now I'm down a copy of Darklight, which I was in the middle of, and I've got to wait until the new copy arrives from Amazon.

On the bright side, I only recently stopped using my metropass as my bookmark at the insistence of Sarah, so at least I didn't lose that... Thanks Sarah!
