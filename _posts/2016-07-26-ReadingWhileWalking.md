I love to walk. I love to explore new places on foot and take in the beautiful sights around me, even commonplace things – shops, people, plants, nice houses, a funny street sign – can be enjoyable when you’re in a new environment.

But walking the same route all the time, or walking long distances can get a bit tedious! As a one-car family, I spent a lot of time walking to and from places as a kid and, it wasn’t long before I figured out that walking time could also be great reading time! I have the gift of reading while walking!

It started with walking home while reading. I would follow the sidewalks, stop at crosswalks to make sure the coast was clear, and put a finger in my book as a marker while I crossed the street, only to resume reading the moment I reached the other side. It was a simple route, pretty much a straight line, and the sidewalks were usually empty. Once I mastered that, I began reading while walking in other places too, namely at school in the hallways between classes, while everyone else was rushing to get across the building, I was calmly meandering along with my nose in my book, waiting for the masses to thin out.

At this point I’ve gotten quite good at reading while walking & definitely consider it my bookish super power. As a master of this power I’m happy to share some of my tips & tricks so you too can hone your skills!


**1. Don't walk too fast**

You don’t have to walk at a snail’s pace, but considering that you are simultaneously reading and monitoring your surroundings, speed walking is highly discouraged!


**2. Follow the person in front of you**

This tip is especially useful in a big crowd of people, when you’re trying not to step on anyone or be stepped on! I like to find someone who walks at a pace similar to mine and follow them, it makes it easier to avoid obstacles when you shadow someone who is actively watching for them! But don’t be creepy; leave a respectable distance between you!

**3. Safety first...**

As I mentioned above, whenever I get to a crosswalk, I close my book and focus on crossing the street; I recommend you do the same. I love all my books, but none of them is worth getting injured for!


**4. Be ready to laugh at yourself**

Though usually I can get from point A to point B without injury – and be a little further along in my current-read too – I have occasionally been known to almost walk into a low wall, trip over something on the ground or miss my turn because I was too engrossed in my book. When these moments occur, be ready to laugh at yourself, and take pride in knowing that anyone who saw the incident will have a funny story to tell his or her friends that day! You’re adding humour to the world; that is always a good thing!


So, are you also a walking reader? Or are you maybe a speed reader, or even a plot psychic? What’s your book-related super power, we want to know, so leave a message int he comments!

Who knows, maybe one day the world will assemble a team of bookish superheros! ;)
(If so, I'll be the first in line to show off my skills! :P )
