I wanted to love this book. I so wanted to love this book. Instead, I found that it dragged on and I read only so that I could finish it, not because I was really all that excited. Let’s break it down.

## Things I liked
The secondary characters in Livingston’s series are amazing. Either amazingly great, amazingly hilarious, amazingly pathetic, whatever it is, they are fantastic. The Fairy monarchs (in particular Mabh and Auberon) are great fun to watch interact. I do however wish we’d seen more Mabh, because her bad assery was always very much enjoyed and brought a light touch (insert joke about queen of air and darkness here) to the book. Auberon is also very fun to read with his gruff demeanor. Titania is a little bit too head in the clouds for my taste, but she serves her purpose. Gwynn however is a mystery right through to the end, which gives the plot a boost and helps make this book a 3 and not lower.

I’ve mentioned him in past reviews for this series, but Bob doesn’t disappoint in this book. His quips add a comical undertone in what would otherwise be considered very serious moments and it balances out a lot of scenes.

That there was more action. And there Is a loooot more action in this one. It was almost 2 short books brought together to create this final one. It made the book pace feel a little bit more reasonable.

One thing this series did very well (and this speaks to the publisher) is with the cover design. They are pretty appealing. I know you’re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but that’s pretty much exactly what I did here. It screams YA in all the right ways.

## Things I did not like

How the book dragged on. Though there was a lot more action, I kept thinking to myself that if even one character asked some of the seemingly obvious questions, everything could be resolved so quickly. I get that I have dramatic irony on my side (knowing what’s going on when the characters don’t), but come on.

Repetitiveness. This kind of ties in to the “why aren’t you asking the right questions” thing, but sometimes characters would really swell on stuff that I as a reader just couldn’t bring myself to care about.  That’s maybe a little harsh of me, but there you go.

To be fair, I can’t help but wonder if my reading this series in one shot might have somehow diminished my excitement by the end. That combined with my [losing book 2 halfway through my reading of it...](/2016/04/16/Lostbook/){:target="_blank"}

# Closing Notes

Despite this, I feel like this series is worth a read for anyone who

1. wants to read some decent Canadian authors
2. Likes Shakespeare
3. Likes novels about Fairies and
4. Can pace the books out

I genuinely think that if I’d read them as they’d come out individually with time in between to enjoy each one, I might have rated it higher.

I guess that’s just how the cookie crumbles. &#35;YesThatsABruceAlmightyReference
