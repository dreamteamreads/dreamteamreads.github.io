I finally finished part two of this series after the whole "losing it in a grocery store and having to reorder from Amazon" mishap. Because of the fact that I was in the middle of the action when I lost my other copy of this book, getting back into it was a bit difficult. I debated restarting, but as it turns out, I am very lazy and so that didn't happen. You win some, you lose some. ON TO THE REVIEW!

## Plot
Sonny has returned to the Fairy realm to shut down fairies left from The Great Hunt. Meanwhile, Kelley is back in New York, learning to use her powers. A plot seems to be brewing for control over the realms.

There was a lot more action in this one than in the first book which I enjoyed. Much like the first one, there was a final fight scene, but there were also a couple strewn throughout. The ending of the book (without giving anything away) broke my heart in the most unnecessary way, but I am excited to see how it ends in the final book.

## Characters
Kelley gets some real chops in this one and has to face a couple difficult decisions throughout the story. Though a touch too melodramatic at times, I will cut her some slack as she is still acclimatizing to the world she now belongs to. I guess anyone would be a little frantic. She does seem to be picking up on things much quicker in this one (except the moment with the note which was **painfully obvious**, Kelley!)

But really, it is Sonny who steals the show in this book. His character develops in a very interesting way (hint: he may be putting his Firecracker on much too high a pedestal) and his chapters were all a rollercoaster of emotions.

<sup>Me, during every chapter involving Sonny.</sup>

Another character I was glad to see back was Puck a.k.a. Bob the Boucca. His character is the perfect mood lightener.

We also get to see a lot more interaction between the monarchs in this one. Two in particular are really fun to watch together (they might not be who you think!) and the plot is definitely thickening there. (Is it bad that I ship the monarchs more than the main characters? They really need more page time)

## Closing notes
This book really delivers on secondary characters while advancing the plot in a new interesting way. While I could do without the excruciating obliviousness/ignorance of certain characters, I still think that overall the book is worth a read. The story ends quite abruptly, leading me to wonder what is going to happen next!
