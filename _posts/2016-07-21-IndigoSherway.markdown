This past weekend, I convinced (read: tricked) Sarah into checking out the new Indigo Chapters store at a mall here in Toronto. I’d heard about the opening of this new location back in May (there was a party and everything), and I’d been meaning to stop by for quite some time. I figured my birthday weekend was as good a time as ever. I was expecting the store to be nice.

I wasn't expecting it to be this nice. I don't exaggerate when I say the following.

This. Store. Is. Beautiful.

I apologize ahead of time, for this post will mostly consist of photos. It's been a long week and words aren't coming to me as easily as usual. That being said, I feel that these photos speak for themselves. I cannot stress enough how much I loved this new Indigo location.

The mall entrance to the store is huge, with very tall ceilings that allow for beautiful floor to ceiling bookshelves. Everything in the store is bright and the walls and fixtures are all white, allowing the books to stand out and shine. Like other Chapters stores, the books are sorted by topic and genre. However, on top of that, the merchandise is also organized into the sections. So the kitchen section has all the kitchen ware. The fashion books are with all the wearable merchandise (such as scarves, jewellery, etc).

There are two floors and the books I am most excited about (YALitFTW!) is located on the second floor. Also located on the second floor is this beautiful blue piano. Sarah and I took the opportunity to play a jingle or two and were very promptly shown up by a 7-year-old. Lesson learned. No more trying to be fancy. And yes, Sarah and I were wearing the same cardigan that day. Dream Team strikes again!

The store is decorated and staged quite beautifully. There are touches of Canadian decorations such as the paddles pictured here (which you can actually buy!), and a dedicated #ReadTheNorth wall with books by Canadian authors.

I feel like Indigo is making a good move by really pushing their lifestyle type marketing as they have in this location. As much as it kills me to say it (and it really does) physical print is not as popular as it used to in our digital age. Indigo has done a good job of keeping up with the times and pushing forward.
